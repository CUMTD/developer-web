Just some notes about the current state of the project

Need to have ryan look over the CSS. there are some overflows that are not scrolling
modify the documentation dropdown to be a click action, not hover
modify the sidebar to be a click and auto-nav and auto-expand, like stripe

would be cool to auto-inject user's API key into the code example.



still need to finish
- ~~api key flow functionality~~
- ~~cleaning up the actual API endpoints~~
- per-endpoint return objects
- SEO page title, description, OG image on every page
- local storage of language
- writing documentation
- test, test, test
- update robots.txt before launch


- write a guide for building a simple app (later?)
- llms.txt
priority this week: content
