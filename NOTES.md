Just some notes about the current state of the project

modify the documentation dropdown to be a click action, not hover
modify the sidebar to be a click and auto-nav and auto-expand, like stripe

would be cool to auto-inject user's API key into the code example.



still need to finish
- ~~api key flow functionality~~
- ~~cleaning up the actual API endpoints~~
- ~~per-endpoint return objects~~ (still need to finalize 2)
- finish documentation
- SEO page title, description, OG image on every page
- favicon
- local storage of language
- update robots.txt before launch
- test, test, test


- write a guide for building a simple app (later?)
- llms.txt
