Just some notes about the current state of the project

Need to have ryan look over the CSS. there are some overflows that are not scrolling
modify the documentation dropdown to be a click action, not hover
modify the sidebar to be a click and auto-nav and auto-expand, like stripe
is there a way to inject api path and key into the MDX examples? also, the code picker is broken.
would be cool to auto-inject user's API key into the code example.
Would be a good idea to add a bunch of padding to the bottom of each reference page, for anchors


still need to finish
- api key flow functionality
- cleaning up the actual API endpoints
- writing documentation
- test, test, test
- some neat visuals
