# Shapes
Shapes are geographical lines. Shapes are used by <Link href="/reference/trips">trips</Link> to represent the physical path a bus takes.

There are two ways to represent shapes:

1. ### GTFS Shape Object
    GTFS shapes conform to <Link href="https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#shapestxt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GTFS definition of a shape.</Link> This shape contains an array of shape points. Each shape point has a sequence, lat/long coordinates, distance travelled, and stopId.

2. ### Encoded Polyline
    Polyline encoding is a lossy compression algorithm created by Google that can represent a series of coordinates with a string. An encoded polyline looks like this:

		`ezsFv{qyO@fDbK?CfI`

	See Google's Encoded Polyline Algorithm documentation for more information on how to encode and decode these strings, as well as the Polyline Utility.
