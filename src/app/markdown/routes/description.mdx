# Routes and Route Groups
A route is what it sounds like — a bus route.

All routes belong to a larger "route group." The route group dictates properties like color, foreground text color and sort order for the routes it contains.

For example, the 5 Green Weekday is a route. It belongs to the Green route group, which contains the 50 Weekday Night, the 50 Weekday Late Night, and so on.
