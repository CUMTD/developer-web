## Boarding Points
A boarding point is where a passenger may board or alight the bus. Every boarding point corresponds to a single bus stop sign. All passenger journeys start and end at a boarding point

## Stop Group
A stop group is a collection of one or more boarding points in a logical or geographic grouping. For example, Illini Union (IU) is a collection of four boarding points.
