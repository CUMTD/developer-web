# Shapes
Shapes are geographical lines. Shapes are used by <a href="/reference/trips">trips</a> to represent the physical path a bus takes.

## Two types of shapes:

### Classic Shapes
Classic shapes are modeled after the GTFS definition of a shape. A classic shape contains an array of shape points. Each shape point has a sequence, lat/long coordinates, distance travelled, and stopId.

### Encoded Polyline Shapes
Polyline encoding is a lossy compression algorithm created by Google that allows you to store a series of coordinates as a single string. View the Google Documentation for more information on how to decode these strings.

Encoded Polyline shapes are a much cleaner and efficient way of representing shapes, at the expense of verbosity. With these type of shapes, you lose stopId and distance travelled information.
