# Shapes
Shapes are geographical lines. Shapes are used by <a href="/reference/trips">trips</a> to represent the physical path a bus takes.

There are two ways to represent shapes:

1. ### GTFS Shape Object
    GTFS shapes conform to <a href="https://gtfs.org/documentation/schedule/reference/#shapestxt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the GTFS definition of a shape.</a> This shape contains an array of shape points. Each shape point has a sequence, lat/long coordinates, distance travelled, and stopId.

	<div className="[&_code]:max-h-50 overflow-y-scroll">
	```json
	{
		"id": "130N SILVER EVENING 2",
		"shapePoints": [
			{
			"sequence": 1,
			"coordinates": {
				"latitude": 40.09949000000001,
				"longitude": -88.220416
			},
			"distanceTraveled": 0,
			"stopId": null
			},
			{
			"sequence": 2,
			"coordinates": {
				"latitude": 40.099466,
				"longitude": -88.220416
			},
			"distanceTraveled": 2.667,
			"stopId": null
			}
		]
	}
	```
	</div>


2. ### Encoded Polyline
    Polyline encoding is a lossy compression algorithm created by Google that can create strings that represent a series of coordinates. An encoded polyline looks like this:

	See Google's Encoded Polyline Algorithm documentation for more information on how to encode and decode these strings, as well as the Polyline Utility.
