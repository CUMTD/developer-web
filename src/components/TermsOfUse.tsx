				nature (including attorneys' fees or costs of defense), whether initiated by Licensee's customers or others,
				arising out of or in connection with Licensee's use or distribution of MTD Data, provided that any such
				allegation or claim is not based on the MTD Data as originally provided. MTD will give Licensee prompt notice of
				any such claim. If MTD requests Licensee to defend MTD, MTD will have the right to participate in the settlement
				or defense, with its own counsel and at its own expense, but Licensee will have the right to control the
				settlement or defense, subject to MTD's prior approval of any settlement.
			</p>

			<h3>Severability</h3>
			<p>
				To the extent a court of competent jurisdiction determines that any part or provision of this Agreement is
				unenforceable as a matter of law, such part or provision of this Agreement will be deemed severable and the
				remainder of this Agreement shall survive and remain enforceable.
			</p>
